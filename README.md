This is my attempt to translate Ichigo Mashimaro (SLPS-25547). I'm trying to keep the translation as close as I can while making dialogue sound natural, and not choppy like a direct transliteration would be. Any help would be appreciated.

"Player" actually translates to "Main Character", so if needed, it can be swapped.

[名前] Is the player name.

[曜日] is days used for showing how many days have passed/are left. 

[場所] is for places, to show an in game location.

I'm leaving them as is so it's easier to reference when it's time to inject the translation into the game.
